# AStarIncMOSPP — Incremental k×A* (MOSPP)

## Purpose

Solves the Many-to-One Shortest Path Problem (MOSPP): the
shortest path from each of `k` starts `[s₁, …, sₖ]` to a
shared single goal `t`.

Runs `k` sequential **forward** `AStarBPMX` sub-searches, one
per start. Unlike `AStarRepMOSPP` (the no-sharing baseline),
each sub-search **carries forward** what earlier ones learned.
Because the start varies, the `SearchStateSPP` bundle does NOT
transfer (OPEN/CLOSED/g/parent are start-relative); instead
two **goal-anchored** stores accumulate (the goal is fixed, so
they stay valid across sub-searches):

- **on-path cache** `cache[x] = h*(x, t)` — harvested by
  `AStarLookup.to_cache()` after each reached sub-search.
- **admissible bounds** `bounds[x] ≥ h*(x, t)` — Adaptive A*
  (`C_i − g_i(x)` for CLOSED x **not already cached**) + the
  inner `HBounded` layer (BPMX-lifted / pathmax-propagated
  values). Cache and bounds are a **disjoint partition** of the
  reused nodes (on-path-exact `cache` vs off-path lower-bound
  `bounds` = CLOSED \ CACHE): a cached node's exact `h*`
  dominates and shadows any bound (HCached intercepts before
  HBounded), so harvesting a bound there would be a dead entry
  that double-counts the node in `mem_cache` + `mem_bounds`.
  The partition is kept from **both** sides: `_harvest_bounds`
  never ADDS a cached key to bounds (skips it in both the
  `C_i − g` sweep and the HBounded-layer copy), and
  `cache.update()` DROPS any newly-cached key from bounds —
  catching a node bounded off-path in an earlier sub-search
  that later becomes on-path (and thus cached).

**Headline win — cache-hit-at-init.** If a later start `s_j`
is already in the carried cache, the inner `AStarLookup` pops
it on the first iteration and `_early_exit` terminates the
sub-search in ONE pop, zero expansions, cost `h*(s_j, t)`.

Mirror of `AStarRepMOSPP._handle_start` with two diffs:
cache-hit-at-init accounting + `to_cache` / `_harvest_bounds`
reuse plumbing. The inner algo is `AStarBPMX` (subsumes
`AStarLookup`; `rule_bpmx=None` ⇒ identical to `AStarLookup`),
so cache, bounds, pre-search `propagate_pathmax`, and in-search
BPMX are all reachable through one inner class.

## Public API

### Constructor

```python
AStarIncMOSPP(problem: ProblemSPP[State],
              h: Callable[[State, State], int],
              name: str = 'AStarIncMOSPP',
              is_recording: bool = False,
              is_timing: bool = True,
              order_starts: str = 'near',
              carry_cache: bool = True,
              adaptive_h: bool = True,
              propagate: bool = False,
              propagate_depth: int | None = None,
              rule_bpmx: str | None = None,
              depth_bpmx: int | None = 1)
```

- `problem.starts` = `[s₁, …, sₖ]`; `problem.goals` must have
  **exactly one** goal (else `ValueError`).
- `h(state, goal) -> int` — bi-arg, admissible. Goal is fixed
  ⇒ the counter-wrapped unary h is built once and reused (also
  the `order_starts` metric — raw, not counted).
- `order_starts ∈ {near, far, mean, random, given}`:
  - `near`/`far` — ascending / descending by `h(start, goal)`.
  - `mean` — ascending by `|h(start, goal) − mean|`.
  - `random` — deterministic shuffle (fixed seed `0`).
  - `given` — `problem.starts` as-is, no reordering (the
    identity policy; the consistent choice for `extend()`-based
    nested chains — see **Extendable** below).
- `carry_cache` / `adaptive_h` — replay the respective
  goal-anchored store across sub-searches.
- **`propagate` is a separate boolean from `propagate_depth`.**
  `propagate_pathmax(depth=None)` means "run to convergence",
  which is distinct from "do not propagate". Without the
  boolean the cache-only config and the propagate-to-
  convergence config would be byte-identical kwargs.
- `rule_bpmx` / `depth_bpmx` — forwarded to the inner
  `AStarBPMX` (`None` ⇒ BPMX off).

### Methods

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `run() -> SolutionMOSPP` | Orchestrate k sequential sub-searches over the policy-ordered starts. |
| `extend(new_starts) -> SolutionMOSPP` | (from `ExtendableMOSPP`) Resume after `run()` with more starts — see **Extendable**. |
| `run_nested(problems, h, ...) -> AStarIncMOSPP` | (classmethod, from `ExtendableMOSPP`) Solve a prefix-extending problem chain in one call. |
| `reconstruct_path(start) -> list[State]` | Returns `[]` by design — sub-search parent pointers are discarded (mirror of `AStarRepMOSPP`). |

### Counter scaffold

Group order mirrors the COUNTERS.html column order:

| group | counters |
|---|---|
| search | `cnt_expanded`, `cnt_generated` |
| propagate | `cnt_prop_attempts`, `cnt_prop_lifts`, `cnt_prop_waves` (MAX-aggregated — see below) |
| bpmx | `cnt_bpmx_attempts`, `cnt_bpmx_lifts`, `cnt_bpmx_depth` (MAX-aggregated — see below) |
| adapt | `cnt_adapt_attempts`, `cnt_adapt_lifts` (orchestrator-owned; Adaptive-A* `_harvest_bounds`) |
| h | `cnt_h_search` (orchestrator-owned; wrapped h) |
| frontier | `cnt_push`, `cnt_pop`, `cnt_decrease` |
| reuse | `cnt_cache_hits_at_init` |
| memory | `mem_open`, `mem_closed`, `mem_cache`, `mem_bounds` — the four **node-count** components of the single **peak (MAX-total) sub-search**. Per sub-search the live coincident occupancy `\|OPEN\| + \|CLOSED\| + \|cache\| + \|bounds\|` is measured (`len(frontier)` / `len(closed)` at sub-search end; cache/bounds as they stand *during* that sub-search, i.e. the 1..i-1 contributions), and the four parts of the largest are kept. `mem_total = Σ mem_*` is then the **exact** coincident peak (the parts co-occur). Node counts, not bytes — `getsizeof` dropped (CPython-overhead noise). |

`cnt_bpmx_lifts` was formerly `cnt_bpmx_successes` — renamed
for prop/bpmx symmetry (`*_attempts` / `*_lifts`); pure
rename, semantics unchanged (it already counted successful
lifts). The rename is global: it is an OOSPP `BPMXMixin`
scaffold counter, so `AStarBPMX` and its OOSPP testers/docs
moved too.

Inner-`AStarBPMX` counters are **summed** across
sub-searches, with three exceptions:
- **`cnt_prop_waves` is MAX-aggregated, not summed.** It is
  a propagation-DEPTH horizon — *the deepest wave ladder any
  single sub-search ran* — not total wave-work. Rationale:
  per sub-search, `propagate_pathmax(depth)` runs ≤ `depth`
  waves; summing across k sub-searches conflates depth with
  count and surprises (`depth_1` would read k−1, not 1). The
  wave *work* is already carried by the summed
  `cnt_prop_attempts` / `cnt_prop_lifts`, so MAX loses no
  information. Mirrors the peak aggregation of `mem_open` /
  `mem_closed` (see `_prop_waves_peak`, flushed in
  `_sync_memory_snapshot`). The first sub-search typically
  contributes 0 (empty carried cache ⇒ no propagate seeds);
  on the canonical fixture `depth_1/2/3 → 1/2/3`,
  `depth_inf → 5`. OMSPP `KAStarInc` never propagates so
  `cnt_prop_waves ≡ 0` there — SUM and MAX coincide; this
  redefinition is MOSPP-only by nature.
- **`cnt_bpmx_depth` is MAX-aggregated, not summed.** Same
  horizon logic: the inner `BPMXMixin` already tracks it
  per-search as a max (deepest BFS-level a lift fired,
  capped by where lifts actually stop — NOT the
  `depth_bpmx` param). Summing k per-search maxima is
  meaningless; the cross-sub-search horizon is the MAX.
  Lift *work* is carried by the summed `cnt_bpmx_attempts` /
  `cnt_bpmx_lifts`. Mirrors `_prop_waves_peak` /
  `mem_*` (see `_bpmx_depth_peak`, flushed in
  `_sync_memory_snapshot`). Within-search semantics are
  unchanged, so standalone `AStarBPMX` is unaffected and no
  OOSPP regeneration was needed; on the canonical MOSPP
  fixture only one sub-search lifts, so SUM and MAX happen
  to coincide (values pinned unchanged).
- `cnt_h_search` is incremented directly by the wrapped h
  (no inner counter).

`cnt_cache_hits_at_init` is orchestrator-owned. No
`cnt_h_update` (no PHASE_UPDATE); `elapsed_update` ≡ 0.0.

**`cnt_adapt_attempts` / `cnt_adapt_lifts`** (orchestrator-owned,
SUM-accumulated across reached sub-searches, both `0` when
`adaptive_h=False`) instrument the Adaptive-A* harvest in
`_harvest_bounds`, symmetric to the BPMX pair: one **attempt** per
plausibly-liftable closed node (`cand = C_i − g_i(x) > 0`, non-cached),
one **lift** when that `cand` tightens the carried bound store. So
`attempts ≥ lifts` and `pct_adapt_lifts = lifts/attempts` is a true
harvest hit-rate. **Sound harvest prune:** closed nodes with `cand ≤ 0`
(`g_i(x) ≥ C_i`, possible only under the inconsistent carried
heuristic) are skipped — `h* ≥ 0` shadows such a bound, so it is dead.
Pruning a node's whole *subtree* on "failed to beat the **accumulated**
bound" would be **unsound** (accumulated bounds are inconsistent → a
child with a weaker stored bound can still lift); only the `cand ≤ 0`
test, measured against the consistent base `h ≥ 0`, propagates safely.

## Recording — event schema

| event | source |
|---|---|
| `push` / `pop` / `decrease_g` | inner `AStarBPMX` (with `is_cached` / `is_bounded` flags from the lookup layers) |
| `propagate_wave` / `propagate` | pre-search `propagate_pathmax` (when `propagate=True`) |
| `pathmax_apply` / `bpmx_iteration` / `bpmx_lift` / `bpmx_forward` | in-search BPMX (when `rule_bpmx` set) |
| `cache_hit_at_init` | sub-search terminated on first pop via the carried cache. Payload: `state, g, start_index` |
| `on_start` | per start at sub-search end. `reason ∈ {expanded, already_reached, unreachable}`; payload `state, g, reason, start_index` |
| `update_frontier` | **NEVER emitted** (no shared frontier) |

`already_closed` is never emitted (no shared CLOSED set).

## Extendable

Composes the `ExtendableMOSPP` capability mixin (same mixin
`AStarRepMOSPP` uses). `extend(new_starts)` resumes the
orchestrator with more starts after `run()`; `run_nested`
chains `run()` + `extend()` over a prefix-extending problem
sequence.

Why it fits naturally:

- **Goal-anchored stores never go stale.** `cache` /
  `bounds` are keyed to the fixed goal, so every entry
  harvested during `run()` stays exact / admissible for
  every later `extend()` sub-search.
- **`extend()` bypasses the reset.** Only `_run()` resets
  `_cache` / `_bounds`; `extend()` does not call `_run()`,
  so the carried stores survive the extend for free — the
  incremental win (cache-hit-at-init) crosses the extend
  boundary.
- Wiring mirrors `AStarRepMOSPP`: `_all_starts` /
  `_last_reached_start` / `_last_algo` bookkeeping;
  `_repush_last_reached_start` is an inert no-op (no shared
  frontier).

**`order_starts` interaction.** `extend()` appends each new
batch in the order given — it never re-applies
`order_starts`. So:

- `order_starts='given'` — `run()` and every `extend()` are
  in `problem.starts` order; an extended run is
  **counter-identical** to a fresh full run (verified in
  `_tester_extend.py::test_extend_equals_fresh_given`).
- `near` / `far` / `mean` / `random` — an extended run stays
  **cost-correct** (A* with admissible h is order-
  independent for correctness) but its counters differ from
  a fresh run: the new batch trails rather than interleaves.

## Algorithm

```
order starts by `order_starts`
cache, bounds = {}, {}
for i, s_i in enumerate(ordered_starts):
    if s_i in solutions:                      # duplicate start
        emit on_start(already_reached); continue
    algo = AStarBPMX(single_start_view(s_i), h=h_wrapped,
                      cache=cache?, goal=t, bounds=bounds?,
                      rule_bpmx=…, depth_bpmx=…)
    algo._recorder = self._recorder
    if propagate: algo.propagate_pathmax(propagate_depth)
    sol = algo.run()                          # may cache-hit-at-init
    accumulate inner counters
    if cache-hit on first pop: cnt_cache_hits_at_init++ ;
                               emit cache_hit_at_init
    emit on_start(expanded | unreachable)
    if reached:
        if carry_cache: cache.update(algo.to_cache())   # on-path exact h*
        if adaptive_h:  harvest Adaptive A* (C_i-g) + HBounded into
                        bounds, for CLOSED \ CACHE only (cache runs
                        first, so its on-path keys are skipped here)
```

## Factory

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `canonical(**kwargs)` | `grid_6x6_zigzag_mospp` (starts (0,0)/(2,3)/(0,3); goal (5,0); costs 15/10/12). `**kwargs` override the config. |
| `graph_abc_two_starts()` | A→B→C, starts [A,B], goal C. Sub-search 2 (B) reuses sub-search-1 cache mid-search. |
| `graph_abc_repeated_start()` | starts [A,A], goal B. Sub-search 2 → `already_reached` fast-path. |

## Tests

| File | Scope | Count |
|---|---|---|
| `_tester.py` | lifecycle: canonical + cache-hit-at-init, multi-goal / bad-policy rejection, duplicate-start fast-path, all 5 order policies (`near`/`far`/`mean`/`random`/`given`) correct, `elapsed_update==0`, no `update_frontier`, empty `reconstruct_path`, carry-cache toggle | 9 |
| `_tester_counters.py` | one method per param config (22: 1 cache + 4 propagate + 13 BPMX + 4 combined); full non-mem counter dict + per-start costs pinned from the oracle | 22 |
| `_tester_recording.py` | one method per param config (22); full normalized event-stream golden master | 22 |
| `_tester_extend.py` | `ExtendableMOSPP` path: protocol check, `extend()` preconditions, `run([prefix]) + extend([rest])` == fresh `run([full])` under `order_starts='given'` (costs + full counters), cache survives extend, chained extend / `run_nested`, inert `_repush` | 8 |

**Group C uses `carry_cache=True`.** The sub-search-1 on-path
cache is BPMX's inconsistency engine on the otherwise-
consistent Manhattan h (same role as the cached beacon in
`AStarBPMX`'s OOSPP testers — see
`i_3_astar_bpmx/CLAUDE.md`). With `carry_cache=False` Rules 1
and 3 never lift and `rule_1_depth_1 == rule_3_depth_1`
(verified collision); with the cache present all 22 tuples are
distinct.

**Group D — Propagate + BPMX (combined quadrant, 4
configs).** `propagate=True` AND `rule_bpmx` set: pre-search
`propagate_pathmax` runs, *then* in-search BPMX, both
writing the one shared `HBounded` layer via max-combine
(admissible — optimality preserved, verified). Configs:
`prop_1_bpmx_rule_CASCADE_depth_1` (shallow+shallow, 24
expanded — underperforms a deep single axis),
`prop_2_bpmx_rule_3_depth_2` /
`prop_2_bpmx_rule_CASCADE_depth_2` (depth-capped propagate
leaves residue both rules harvest: `prop_lifts>0` AND
`bpmx_lifts>0`), and `prop_inf_bpmx_rule_3_depth_3` (the
**subsumption canary** — `rule_3_depth_3` lifts 4 in
isolation but **0** here because convergent propagation
already saturated `HBounded`). **Decision guide:** on this
fixture there is *no expansion synergy* — the grid saturates
at 23 and propagation is the cheap global informer
(`cnt_h_search` ≈ 88 at convergence) while BPMX is the
expensive local one (100s–1000s). Prefer propagation; reach
for BPMX only when uncached or propagation is depth-capped
and residual inconsistency remains. Real synergy would need
a harder fixture where neither axis alone reaches the
expansion floor (separate fixture-design task).

`study/oracle.py` (script-only — no CLAUDE.md) dumps the 22
counter tuples and asserts distinctness; it is the source of
the `_tester_counters.py` pins. Run:
`python -m f_hs.algo.i_1_mospp.i_1_astar_inc.study.oracle`.

`study/gen_counters.py` (script-only — no CLAUDE.md) is the
generator: it re-runs the 22 `study/oracle.py` configs,
recomputes the per-column traffic scale (green = column min,
red = column max) + duplicate grouping, and splices a fresh
`<table>` into `COUNTERS.html` (hand-written chrome
untouched). Run:
`python -m f_hs.algo.i_1_mospp.i_1_astar_inc.study.gen_counters`.

`COUNTERS.html` is the human-eye view of the same data: an
22-config × 8-counter param-sensitivity heatmap (each
column traffic-scaled independently — green at the column
min, red at the max; only
param-discriminating counters are shown — every shown
column moves), grouped A/B/C/D with the fixture and the
design-decision callouts. Column order follows the
counter-scaffold group order (search · propagate · bpmx:
`cnt_expanded, cnt_generated, cnt_prop_attempts,
cnt_prop_lifts, cnt_prop_waves, cnt_bpmx_attempts,
cnt_bpmx_lifts, cnt_bpmx_depth`). The derived `uniq`
✓/≡ column was removed — collapsed configs remain visible
via row-dimming + the `≡ canonical` badge.
**Five counters are omitted from the heatmap** (all kept
in the class scaffold / `_tester_counters.py`):
- `cnt_decrease` — invariant `≡ 0` (no priority-decrease
  on this all-reachable unit-cost fixture).
- `cnt_cache_hits_at_init` — the algorithm's **headline**
  metric, NOT vestigial. Constant `= 1` here only because
  every config carries the cache and the S1→T optimal-path
  geometry is param-independent (exactly S2 lands on it):
  the invariance is **fixture-geometry**, not structural.
  Across fixtures it ranges `[0, k−1]` and is the sole
  counter-side (recording-OFF) witness of the
  cache-hit-at-init win — not derivable from the aggregate
  frontier/search counters (the `cnt_pop ≡ cnt_expanded+k`
  identity is blind to it). Surfaced via the fixture
  callout + `study/oracle.py` / `_tester_counters.py`, just
  not as a flat heatmap column.
- `cnt_push` / `cnt_pop` — affine duplicates on this
  all-reachable unit-cost fixture: given `cnt_decrease ≡ 0`,
  `cnt_push ≡ cnt_generated` and `cnt_pop ≡
  cnt_expanded + k` (k=3 starts). The generator asserts
  the identity (a fixture that breaks it re-surfaces them).
- `cnt_h_search` — dropped by request (pure
  heuristic-evaluation cost). It is the **sole** separator
  of two BPMX depth tails, so on the shown counters only
  **16 of 22** configs differ; the 6 collapsed configs are
  tagged `≡ <canonical>` and dimmed, and the badge reads
  `16 / 22` (amber). Full 22-way distinctness (incl.
  `cnt_h_search` / push / pop) is the contract verified by
  `study/oracle.py` and `_tester_counters.py` — COUNTERS.html
  is a readability view, not the distinctness oracle.

Regenerate after any counter-affecting change via
`python -m …study.gen_counters` (re-runs the oracle configs;
do not hand-edit table cells). Dark-themed, self-contained;
for human reading only (Claude reads CLAUDE.md).

**Display conventions (preserve on regeneration —
`gen_counters.py` already enforces all of these).** Width
is fitted to the screen, no horizontal scroll: the table
sits in a vertical-scroll container (`max-height:72vh`,
sticky header). Cells use a per-column traffic scale —
green at the column min, red at the column max, yellow at
the midpoint (HSL hue 120→0); a constant column renders
neutral. Columns follow the counter-scaffold group
order; the `uniq` column is dropped (dimming + `≡ canonical`
badge replace it). Counter headers drop the `cnt_` prefix.
The two globally-invariant params
(`carry_cache=True, adaptive_h=False`) are lifted out of
every row's kw line into a single "Display" note; the kw
line shows only the discriminating params. These are
presentation-only — the counter data and the
distinctness contract are unchanged.

## Assumptions & limitations

1. **Admissible h** (cache holds exact h*; Adaptive A* / HBounded are
   admissible LBs). Consistency NOT required — BPMX exists for
   inconsistent h.
2. **Exactly one goal** — `ValueError` at construction
   otherwise.
3. **Non-negative edge costs** (inherited from `ProblemSPP` /
   A* correctness).
4. **Path reconstruction unsupported** — sub-search bundles
   discarded.
